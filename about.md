## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

I am a current master student in Information Systems Management, with a concentration in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (MISM BIDA). I am actively looking for quantitative analysis internship opportunities starting in May 2018.

My strength lies in statistical analysis, data visualization, data cleaning and database management. I enjoy using analytics to understand problems, identify opportunities and make better data-informed decision for enterprise or public policy.

As a data driven person with strong communication and technical skill, I am confident that my past work experience and current courses in BIDA have strengthened my analytics skills and enabled me to work in diverse communities.

### Content is Imortant

  In saying that, a one-measure fits-all approach won't do the trick with regards to content promoting. Rather, an emphasis on making remarkable, high caliber and totally genuine content that is engaging, helpful and fascinating for customers will get you the crown. From content, video and symbolism to infographics, studies, online courses and podcasts, whatever your favored content medium is, guarantee it is shareable and pertinent to your industry.
