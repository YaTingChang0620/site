## About Me

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>


<p>I am YA-TING CHANG, graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, and major in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. 
I tell story with data and like to help people make better decision! I am from Taiwan and currenlty live in Pittsburgh, studying for a Master's degree.</p>

<p>My strength lies in Statistical Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis and Programming in R. 
Things I found interesting are Supervised Learning including Regression and Tree-Based Methods. 
And things I want to learn more are Natural Language Processing and Clustering.</p>
 
<p>Previously, I worked in the advertising and health supplement industries and focused on analyzing customer behavior 
in the digital world. Two years ago out of curiousity, I joined a side project in the data for social good program, a turning point that I decided to shift my career into the data science world.</p>

<p>I went back to school and feel surprised at everything I learn everyday. I will graduate on Decemeber 2018 and 
currently I am actively looking for quantitative analysis internship opportunities starting in May 2018.
My cv could be found here. Thank you and nice to meet you!</p>
